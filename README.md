# Minesweeper
This is the project my pair (Michael) and I did in Hack Reactor coding challenge. We tried to recreate Minesweeper in 2 hours. I focus on generating the board, placing bomb, and updating each position's nearby bomb count in the beginning while Michael did the layout and jQuery. We then worked together for click event. 

The tile will show the number for nearby bombs. If there is no number, then there is no bomb. If you hit red tile, then that's a bomb. 

Functions to be build after two hour: changing board size, bomb amount, bomb image after click, restart game button, placing flag function, winning/losing notification. 

It was fun to do it in short period of time! Let's play Minesweeper together!
